# POS-Plus
POS-Plus frees up thousands of dollars of critical business start-up funds by by allowing the customer to easily import inventory. This circumvents the need for seller-side programming of the inventory system and will include standard POS functions as well as an inventory system module. The inventory system module will navigate the user through uploading an inventory via spreadsheet and will take that data, reformat it, and link to the database.
